# Common Passwords: Risks and Dangers
In today's digital age, the prevalence of common passwords poses a substantial threat to cybersecurity. Despite growing awareness of online risks, individuals persist in using easily guessable passwords such as "123456" or "password." This lax approach opens the door to cybercriminals who exploit weak passwords through techniques like brute force attacks and dictionary attacks. The consequences are far-reaching, including compromised personal and financial security. In particular, the reuse of common passwords across multiple accounts increases the risk of credential stuffing, allowing attackers to gain unauthorized access to various platforms. To mitigate these risks, individuals must adopt robust password hygiene practices, creating complex passwords, avoiding predictable patterns, and implementing two-factor authentication. By doing so, users can fortify their digital defenses and contribute to a safer online environment.

# Dictionary Brute-force Attack
A dictionary brute-force attack is a type of password cracking method used by attackers to gain unauthorized access to a system or an account. In this type of attack, the attacker systematically tries all the words or strings from a predefined list, often called a "dictionary," to guess the correct password. The dictionary contains commonly used passwords, words found in dictionaries, and other likely combinations.

Unlike a traditional brute-force attack, where every possible combination of characters is tried, a dictionary attack is more focused and efficient. It leverages the likelihood that users often choose passwords that are easy to remember, such as common words, phrases, or combinations of characters.
